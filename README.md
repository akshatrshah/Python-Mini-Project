We have worked to make a banking management system (named as: THE INDIAN BANK) which has the following features:
- Opening a new account
- Withdraw money 
- Deposit money 
- Check customer details
- Delete Account
- Take loan
- Repayment loan
- Overseas Transfers 
- Interaccount Trnasfers
- Speech recognition (to accept the voice of the user and selecting which feature of the bank to use)
- Text to speech

For starting the banking application, user must say "hey bank" and specify the option he she wants to go to from they menu. A text to speech will assisst the user throught the feature where various details of the account will be asked and matched with the data that is available with the bank. In case incorrect credentials are given user will be guided out of the application. For any work carried out with the bank, user can generate a written statement of their action having time and date mentioned in it.
