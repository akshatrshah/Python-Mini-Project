We have worked to make a banking management system (named as: THE INDIAN BANK) which has 11 features as mentioned below:
- Opening a new account
- Withdraw money 
- Deposit money 
- Check customer details
- Delete Account
- Take loan
- Repayment loan
- Overseas Transfers 
- Interaccount Trnasfers
- Speech recognition (to accept the voice of the user and selecting which feature of the bank to use)
- Text to speech 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) Opening a new account: Anyone can use this program and create an account with our bank.
 
2) Withdraw: The required details are asked from the user and he is allowed to withdraw amount from his account if he has sufficient balance and provides correct credenials.

3) Deposit: The required details are asked from the user and he is allowed to deposit  amount to his account provided creditenials are correct.

4) Check details: On providing correct credenials his account number, account holder name, Balance amount and outstanding loan amounts are displayed. 

5) Delete Account: Every account holder can anytime can delete his account(only if his loan amount is cleared).

6)
The main idea of this project is for the use of a blind person to be able to use this application, as we have put the text to speech in this program so that a visually challlenged person is guided through it. 
Speech recognition is used only to accept the choice of the user, and later it is not used to maintain the privacy of the user. 
After every activity the user can generate a pdf of the activity as a proof in case of any conflict with the bank. The pdf will have date and time of the transaction.
Incase the user enters incorrect pin or value he is directly guided out that feature so that no one can gain access into someone's account by guessing his account details.
