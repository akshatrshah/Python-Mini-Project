We have worked to make a banking management system (named as: THE INDIAN BANK) which has 11 features as mentioned below:
- Opening a new account
- Withdraw money 
- Deposit money 
- Check customer details
- Delete Account
- Take loan
- Repayment loan
- Overseas Transfers 
- Interaccount Trnasfers
- Speech recognition (to accept the voice of the user and selecting which feature of the bank to use)
- Text to speech 

The main idea of this project is for the use of a blind person to be able to use this application, as we have put the text to speech in this program so that a visually challlenged person is guided through it.
